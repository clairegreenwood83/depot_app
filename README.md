# Depot Application

## Drescription
This is a web based shopping cart application called Depot. I have built this application incrementally, through completing the tasks in the book 'Agile Web Development with Rails 7', in order to improve my knowledge and understanding of both Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

The homepage of this application can be seen in the image below:

Customers can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, checkout and enter their details to allow an order to be made for delivery of their product. The administration user can manage and review orders via a login in page and also view and edit the products they sell. Administration users are also able to receive and respond to support emails via Action Mailbox. 

## Deployment

The Depot web application has been deployed to nginx, using PostGreSQL.
